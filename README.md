The BluePov firmware
====================

BluePoV is a persistence of vision display, just some leds rotating at ~2400rpm creating the illusion of a floating image, communicated over bluetooth with a pc or an android device.

This is the firmware running on a Freescale Colfire MCF51AC128 uC, controlling the leds and receiving the pixel matrix asynchronously from any pc or smartphone.

The display, developed over 8 weeks, is the final project of Pio IX secondary school.
